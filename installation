Search for "Bitnami WordPress".
Select the Bitnami WordPress AMI from the AWS Marketplace.
Choose Instance Type:
Select an appropriate instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free tier eligibility).
Configure Instance:
Configure your instance settings as needed. You can use the default settings for a basic setup.
Add Storage:
Configure storage options as needed. The default settings are usually sufficient for a basic setup.
Add Tags:
Add tags to your instance (optional). Tags can help you identify your instances.
Configure Security Group:
Create a new security group or select an existing one.

Ensure SSH (port 22) is allowed to access the instance remotely.
Review and Launch:
Review your settings and click "Launch".
Select or create a new key pair. Download the key pair file (.pem) and keep it safe. You will need this to access your instance.
           




                LOAD BALANCER 
AWS Account: Ensure you have an active AWS account.
EC2 Instances: Ensure you have at least two running EC2 instances to attach to the load balancer.
Step-by-Step Guide
 Launch the EC2 Instances (if not already done)
Log in to AWS Management Console:
Go to the AWS Management Console and log in with your credentials.
Navigate to EC2 Dashboard:
In the AWS Management Console, find and select "EC2" under the "Services" menu.
Launch Instances:
Click on the "Launch Instance" button.
Follow the instructions to launch at least two instances that will be used behind the load balancer.
2. Create a Load Balancer
Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard:
In the AWS Management Console, go to the "EC2 Dashboard".
Select Load Balancers:
In the left-hand menu, under "Load Balancing", select "Load Balancers".
Create Load Balancer:
Click the "Create Load Balancer" button.
Choose the type of load balancer you need (e.g., Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or Classic Load Balancer).
3. Configure the Load Balancer
Basic Configuration:
Provide a name for your load balancer.
Select the scheme (Internet-facing or Internal).
Choose the IP address type (IPv4 or dualstack).
Listeners:
Configure listeners by selecting the protocol and port for your load balancer to receive traffic (e.g., HTTP on port 80).
Availability Zones:
Select the VPC and the availability zones where your load balancer will route traffic. Ensure your EC2 instances are in the selected availability zones.
Security Groups:
Choose an existing security group or create a new one. Ensure that the security group allows inbound traffic on the ports your load balancer is configured to use.
4. Configure the Target Group
Target Group:
Create a new target group or select an existing one.
Provide a name for the target group.
Select the target type (Instances, IP addresses, or Lambda functions).
Health Checks:
Configure health check settings. Specify the protocol and path for health checks (e.g., HTTP and /index.html).
5. Register Targets
Add Instances:
Add the EC2 instances you want to include in the target group.
Select the instances and click "Include as pending below".
Review and Create:
Review all settings and click the "Create" button.
6. Test the Load Balancer
DNS Name:
Once the load balancer is created, go to the load balancer details and copy the DNS name.
Access the Load Balancer:
Open a web browser and enter the DNS name of the load balancer. You should be directed to one of your EC2 instances.
Verify Traffic Distribution:
Refresh the browser several times to ensure traffic is being distributed across your instances.








AUTO SCALING GROUP 
AWS Account: Ensure you have an active AWS account.
EC2 Instances: Ensure you have at least one EC2 instance setup or an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that you can use to launch new instances.
Step-by-Step Guide
1. Create a Launch Template or Configuration
A launch template or configuration specifies the instance configuration information for your Auto Scaling group.
Create a Launch Template

Click "Create launch template".
Create a Launch Configuration
Navigate to Auto Scaling:
In the EC2 Dashboard, under "Auto Scaling", select "Launch Configurations".
Create Launch Configuration:
Click on "Create launch configuration".
Provide a name for the launch configuration.
Choose an AMI and instance type.
Configure any additional instance settings.
Click "Create launch configuration".
2. Create an Auto Scaling Group
Navigate to Auto Scaling Groups:
In the EC2 Dashboard, under "Auto Scaling", select "Auto Scaling Groups".
Create Auto Scaling Group:
Click on "Create Auto Scaling group".
Provide a name for the Auto Scaling group.
Select the launch template or launch configuration created in the previous step.
Click "Next".
Configure Group Size and Scaling Policies:

Click "Next".
Configure Network:
Select the VPC and subnets where the Auto Scaling group will launch instances.
Click "Next".
Configure Advanced Options:
Configure load balancer options if needed (e.g., attach to an existing load balancer or target group).
Click "Next".
